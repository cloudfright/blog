## What is AI art?

Generative AI can take human prompts and generate an output. This typically takes the form of a text input which is then used to generate an image based on the context of the text input. And the generated images are often astonishing. Not only that, but these AI tools can generate variations of images based on the style of a supplied image. It can even copy an artist's style, without copying any of their artwork, just by putting the artist's name in the prompt, for example, "A horse standing in a field by a barn in the style of Turner". Parts of an image can also seamlessly replaced with another image using a process called 'in-painting'.

Some of the most talked about AI artist tools are:

[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) from Midjourney

## How does it work?



Interpret text, supervised model trained on images and styles, Associate the text 




Trained on labelled images
- understands objects and the relationships between objects - give example
- sometimes pulled from the internet and the alt text is used as a label

- Output image does not come from the training data
- - Deep learning model
- Feature extraction - build mathematical space - more than 500 dimensions  - clustering
- Randomness in the generation ensures the output will be unique each team


- generative process called Diffusion 

## We've been here before

The Camera Obscrura was used by artists in the 16th century as painting aid. A small hole let light into a dark room, revealing an upside-down that could be used as a reference to capture the perspective. Even portable units were developed. Many artists saw this as cheating, but in reality artists were adapting to newly available tools and techniques. As the camera obsuca became more portable, and with the advances with printing images, the portable camera was born, with the first photograph printed in 1825.

The hot questions at the time were "Are portrait painters going to be put out of business?", and "Is taking taking a photograph really creative?" After all, taking a picture involved little effort, was almost instantaneous and was just capturing the image in front of it. As it turned out, there was a lot of room for creativity for photographers when composing the image, use of different lenses, filters and hand-crafting the prints to introduce effects not present in the original image. The mass production of cameras in the 50s democratised creativity for many people. This is a common theme, we'll come back to.

In the world of music has gone a similar journey. From purely acoustic instruments, to electric instruments that could be amplified, to ever more portable studio-quality production software. Now 




- Cameras putting portrat artists out of business - photography changed the work of portrait artists 
- Even with photography, the professionals still stand out from the amatuers, that's a combination of more experience and often better equipment, but now the playing field is levelled to an extent (unless arties increasinly use more powerful computers)

Artists need to undestand that technology and try to adapt  -

- Synths, drum machines, sequencers - produce a hit album in your bedroom with little experience - this has allowed more people to do it and the market to flourish and many people to express themselves - although it's fair to say, not many people are making a living out of it - NEEDS CITATION  

## How are artists reacting to AI Art?

Artists appear to have two distinct reactions, either "Do I still have a livelihood?", or "How can use this new art form to my advantage".
Artists spend years training, practising to hone their style and if anyone who can form a sentence can create high-quality art in a myriad of styles, what uniqueness is there left for artists to express their individuality? Some artists  engaged with AI art are exploring **prompt craft** - how to creatively craft the text prompt to generate art that is unique to the creator of the prompt.

Artist James Gurney believes the consumes of AI-generated art should be able to see the text prompt and artists should be able to opt out of their artwork used in the training set.



Zipf's law - most people use simple words - "prompt craft"


"DALLE-2 is an example of how iumaginative humans and clever systems can work together to make new things, amplifying our creative potential"


"prompt engineering" - use long list of words , get unpredictable things back


james  Gurney beleives that viewers of the art should be able to see the prompt that generated the picture and also artists should be allowed to opt out of having their artwork used in the training set


Some artists are upset around the copyright problems 

- Mario Klingermann - "you have to know the right words for the spell"
If 10,000 people have access to the same model, will I still be able to make something that people will want to buy, or would they prefer to make it themselves in my style?
Some artists took decades to perfect their style and now all it takes is to for someone to put their name into a prompt to product a realistic - good artists copy and great artists steal
When everyone is in the same space, what can you claim is yours?

Rob sheridan - art director and designer - "If anyone can do this, what's the currency now, what value can an artist bring to the table"? In the future, everyone is an art director 
You conceived what it is, and that's a skill in itself - this could make our lives more valueable 
Everything in art is inspired by something else - everything's a remix


Ryan Murdock - it will change our priorities and change what's special to us
Art is in the prompt as well as the image


When we look at a piece of art will we care  or even know if it's AI-generated or not

Bokar N'Diaye - the AI doesn't create, it assembles, combines - which we've all be doing throughout human history 

Hannah Johnston - with photography is the photographer really the artist or is the camera just a tool

## What's next the target for AI tools?

- Can use tools like this to actively explore art hisotory - Ted underwood (professor univeristy of illinois)

- Music - reason chord maker 

= Writing

Conversation points.. 
- Innovation comes at a price
- Stock images (what other industries could be affected?)
- If everyone can create art, what does this mean? 
- Talk about examples in the past of creative music tools that present threats and how it turned out e.g. synths, autotune, sequences, quanitising etc.
- Writing and music might head in that direction
- Will the public prefer end up preferring AI-generated art/music/writing?
- What's left for humans - the physical world of creativity e.g. live performance?
- Will AI only dominate the digital world?
