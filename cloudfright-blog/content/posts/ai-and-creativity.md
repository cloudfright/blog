Will AI kill creativity?

Summary: the rise of AI art driven from text prompts such as DALLE-2, Midjourney and others is reducing the creative barriers needed to create high-quality art. What does this mean for the future of human artists?

Conversation points.. 
- Innovation comes at a price
- Stock images (what other industries could be affected?)
- If everyone can create art, what does this mean? 
- Talk about examples in the past of creative music tools that present threats and how it turned out e.g. synths, autotune, sequences, quanitising etc.
- Writing and music might head in that direction
- Will the public prefer end up preferring AI-generated art/music/writing?
- What's left for humans - the physical world of creativity e.g. live performance?
- Will AI only dominate the digital world?
