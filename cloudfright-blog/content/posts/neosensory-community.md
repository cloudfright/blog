## Neosensory

Neosensory was founded by Professor David Eagleman, a U.S. neuroscientist based at at Standford University. Neosensory are on a mission to bring new senses to humankind through touch along with help those with impaired senses. Professor Eagleman introduces the concept in his popular TED Talk - [Can we create new senses for humans?](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans?language=en). 

The underlying concept of sensory substitution is that our brains are really good at turning sensory input into meaning. Traditionally, that's done through our existing five senses: sound, light, smell, taste and touch. But what neuroscientists have been wondering since the early 1960s is can we substitute one sense for another? For example, could we stimulate our touch with patterns derived from say, speech. And thus could we learn to 'hear' through our skin? 

The superpower we all have in our brains is pattern recognition.
