## What's in it for you? ##

There's a quiet revolution that's been underway for sometime. It's the revolution of how computers can be used to solve problems. 
Machine learning began in the labs many years ago and is now mainstream and fully embedded in our lives. We'll look at some examples later in the post. 

Whether you're in a technology profession, or a consumer of technology, machine learning will increasingly dominate our lives, and so we can choose to either swim with the tide, or get carried away. We don't necessarily need to become experts, but we owe it to ourselves and our careers to learn enough to be able to ask better questions. If you're a software developer, then understanding more about machine learning will expand your career options and help you navigate future 'build vs buy' decisions.  Don't let complacency lead to your obsolescence!

## Defining machine learning ##

Machine learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with AI defined as non-biological intelligence and intelligence defined as the ability to solve complex tasks. Machine learning leverages statistical models derived from example data in order to provide a prediction based on new data.

## What problems does it solve? ##

The traditional approach to solving problems using programmatic methods, normally involves a series of instructions that execute step-by-step in a defined sequence.  A collection of rules and evaluate those rules based on a series of inputs. And this approach is fine for the vast majority of problems, but when the rules become complex or unmanageable, that's when example-based approaches can prove advantageous. Machine learning is not a new way to solve familiar problems, but instead a way to solve new kinds of problems​.

Imagine if you were asked to write some code to determine whether a picture contains a fish. Where would you start? Well, you might begin by defining a shape of a fish to look for in a picture, but different fish have different shapes, the angle of the fish in the photograph may vary along with the colour of the fish against the background. How could you build rules for every possibility? The answer: use a machine learning example-driven approach and train a machine learning model to recognise a fish from a large set of examples that contain variety of shapes, sizes, angles and colours.  

Machine learning is often used a number of ways:

- Classification (what type of thing is this?)
- Regression (what is the predicted value?)
- Clustering (what related data can be grouped together?)
- Anomaly detection (what data is out of place?)

Markov trees​



## How do you teach a machine ? ##

Machine learning can be divided into supervised learning, where information models are trained with labelled examples, and unsupervised learning, where the machine learning process is let loose on data to see what can be discovered. 

Supervised learning focuses on supporting the learning processing through many examples of data that are labelled, that is examples that contain a description of the the what the example is. The greater the number of examples used in the training process, the better, although there is a trade off with accuracy and time to train the model. Over training?

Neural networks and interconnected computational nodes, are used to create structures that influenced by the connectivity of the brain. This approach is called deep learning. 



## Everyday machine learning  ## 

Machine learning impacts our day to day lives in more ways than we realise, for example:

## Unsupervised learning 
- Online banking: is this transaction fraudulent?
- Customer analysis: what type of customers do we have?​


## Supervised learning 
- Money lending: is this customer a safe bet?
- Customer analysis: is this customer likely to leave the service?
- Facial recognition: unlocking your with your face phone, face mapping onto emojis
- Content moderation: does an image or written text contain offensive material?
- Sentiment analysis: are our customers speaking positively or negatively about us on social media?
- Medical diagnosis: does a scan from an x-ray, MRI, or CT scan contain signs of disease?
- Self-driving cars: what action should I perform next based on what my sensors are telling me?
- Visual search
- 


## Seeing this in action ##

It's helpful to see machine learning in action. Daniel Shiffman, better known as author of The Nature of Code and presenter of the coding train has an excellent entry-level video where he uses Google Teachable Machine to recognise a few objects. Take a look at this and then try it yourself at [Google Teachable Machine]()

 So what's happening with Google Teachable Machine? This is classification in action, in this case, recognising a number of objects through examples, and then providing a percentage confidence score for the object based on new images from the webcam.


## Thinking different ## 

Because machine learning is based on statistical analysis, the outputs of a model are probabilities, that is the likelihood, or confidence. Coupled with this
- Probability vs determinism 
- randomness  

Moving from exact answers to probabilities and predictions

## What are the limitations? ##

- bias  Link to Hannah Fry's book
- transparency 
Stochastic models vs determinism​
Ethics (link to next piece on moral machine)​

## Going deeper ##

- neurons 
- patterns and architectures 
- supervised vs unsupervised (refer back to coding train)
- classification, regression
- clustering and anomaly detection
- feed forward networks 



## Your next steps ##

For developers 

- coding traing ML5 (great way to learn as no environments needed)
- mastering machine learning 

For curious minds 

What examples can you uncover in your everyday life that use machine learning?
AI and ML is set to get more powerful and pervasive​
