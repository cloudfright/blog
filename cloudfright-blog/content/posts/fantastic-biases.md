Whether we recognise it or not, we're all suspectable to cognitive biases. They're everywhere.
What's the big deal you might say?  Well, cognitive biases affect the way we think, the way we act, our judgements, and the decisions we make.

In its simplest form, a cognitive bias is an error in our thinking that affects our rational thought process and can lead us astray. 

Biases arise from our subconscious and unconscious aspects of our mind with along with the conscious thought, is split into three levels:  

- Conscious: awareness of our thoughts and actions
- Subconscious: part of our conscious experience, but not the focal point of our awareness, more like an autopilot, but one that can be examined through introspection
- Unconscious: a deeper, automatic thought process outside of our awareness 


## Why are we biased?

Our brains love shortcuts. Part of our survival mechanisms are pattern matching, threat detection and survival-based decision making

## Traps to avoid

Here are biases that I believe are most important to watch out for

1. Confirmation bias
2. Affinity bias - group think - finding someone that reminds you of yourself
3. Halo effect
4. Availability bias - what you see is all there is - we put more weight on recent information
5. Anchoring & Framing
