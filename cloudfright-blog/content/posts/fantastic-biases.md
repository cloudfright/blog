Whether we recognise it or not, we're all suspectable to cognitive biases. They're everywhere.
What's the big deal you might say?  Well, cognitive biases affect the way we act, our judgement of ourselves and others, and the decisions we make.

In its simplest form, a cognitive bias is an error in our thinking that affects our rational thought process and can lead us astray. 


## Why are we biased?

We are a product of our upbringing, prejudices and world view. And our brains love shortcuts and jumping to conclusions that afford efficiency and speed of thought. We use pattern matching extensively to quickly assess opportunities, threats and to direct survival-based decision making. 

Humans experience different layers of awareness:  

- Conscious: awareness of our thoughts and actions
- Subconscious: part of our conscious experience, but not the focal point of our awareness, more like an autopilot, but one that can be examined through introspection
- Unconscious: a deeper, automatic thought process outside of our awareness 

Our reality is built within our brains based on a model of expectations of the outside world. Evidence of this can be seen with optical illusions where our expectations are at odds with what our eyes are presented with. Our internal model us built over time Using real-world experience and learned behaviour. And it's this model that that powers perception and much of our decision making.


## Hidden from view

So why aren't we aware of our biases? Why can't we identify them and simply adjust our behaviour? Because it takes effort, and effortful thinking is not our primary mode of operation. Many of our actions are orchestrated behind the scenes by our unconscious brain. Have you ever driven home from somewhere, unlocked the door and had no recollection of the journey? This is out unconscious brain at its best - our *automatic pilot* when we need it. And in the same way, our biases are often automatic responses to learned behaviour. We act in a particular way without conscious thought. 

Enter Behavioural Science. Behavioral science describes the study of human behavior through the use of systematic experimentation and observation. This is an extensive field of learning that has expanded our knowledge of human behaviour and identified [hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases
) of biases.

We are often unaware
But when you become of aware of it in yourself and in others 

How can it impact us?
Conducting interviews 
Decision making 

How can it help us?

How it ties it Critical thinking and the benefits of that

## Traps to avoid

Here are biases that I believe are most important to watch out for

1. Confirmation bias - seeking out information that confirms an existing belief 
2. Affinity bias - group think - finding someone that reminds you of yourself
3. Halo effect - letting a single positive attribute of a person mask negative obvious attributes 
4. Availability bias - what you see is all there is - we put more weight on recent information
5. Anchoring & Framing - how something is explained affects your decision

## What's in it for me?

- better thinking 
- taking responsibiliy
