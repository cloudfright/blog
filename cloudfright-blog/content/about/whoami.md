Hello there. My name is Ben, I live in the South East of the UK. I lead software engineering teams for a living. 

I explore my curiosity and write about my journey. I'm a guide, not a guru.

If you'd like to get in touch, DM on me [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudfright). Please be kind. I like kind people. 


> P.S. Why the name cloudfright? I guess I was riffing off [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/). I thought cloudfright sounded cool at the time. Now I'm not so sure.
